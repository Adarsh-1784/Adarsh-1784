Color Sorting Bot
Overview

The Color Sorting Bot is an Arduino-based project designed to automatically detect and separate objects based on their color. Using a TCS3200 color sensor, Arduino Uno, and a servo motor, the bot identifies the color of each object and sorts it into the correct container.

Components Used

Arduino Uno
TCS3200 Color Sensor
Servo Motor (SG90 / MG90S)
Power Supply (9V or external battery pack)
Connecting wires & breadboard
Sorting mechanism / chassis

Working Principle

The color sensor detects the color of an incoming object.
The detected color values (RGB) are sent to the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino processes the data and determines the color category.
The servo motor rotates to a specific position corresponding to the detected color bin.
The object is released into the correct section.
